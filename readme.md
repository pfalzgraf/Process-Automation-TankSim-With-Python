# Process Automation Tank Simulation with Python

## Overview

This project is an interactive Python simulation of a tank filling and draining system, designed to emulate industrial process control principles.

- **Tank level dynamics** driven by inflow and outflow rates  
  - Models real-world fluid behavior, capturing how the tank responds over time to changes in input and output.  
- **PID control for maintaining target tank levels**  
  - Demonstrates advanced process automation concepts by automatically adjusting inflow to achieve and maintain a desired setpoint, highlighting feedback control and real-time system response.
